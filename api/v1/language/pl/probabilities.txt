# pl language letter distributions for Lexica
# 
# Automatically generated by a genetic algorithm run with 1000 iterations
#  - Each iteration, 100 4 x 4 Lexica boards were generated.
#  - The fitness function looks at how many words can be played on each of these boards.
#  - Fitness is defined as "(Mean * Mean) - (Standard Deviation * Standard Deviation).
#
# The goal is boards that on average have a high number of words available (boards with zero or only a small number of words are not good),
# but the standard deviation is low (some languages tend to result in boards with hundreds of words, which is also not particularly great).
#
# Fitness for this probability:
#   Min: 40, mean: 178, max: 355, stddev: 69, score: 21995

# Note: As per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions#Polish:
# 
# > The letters Q, V and X have always been absent (since they are used in foreign words), and blank tiles cannot be used to represent these. 
# 
# Therefore we will not include them in Lexica. There are still some words in the dictionary which include them, but only ~500
# out of a total of ~430,000 words, therefore we're not concerned about removing them from the dictionary to save space.
